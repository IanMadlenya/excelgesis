# excelgesis

The goal of excelgesis is to access and edit XML inside xlsx. Helper package for development and debugging of [readxl](https://github.com/hadley/readxl). Intended for personal/diagnostic use.

Some prepared example workbooks:

<https://jennybc.github.io/excelgesis/>

The definitive reference is Standard ECMA-376 Office Open XML File Formats:

  * <http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-376.htm>

## Installation

You can install excelgesis from github with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jennybc/excelgesis")
```

## Usage

List the included examples.

```{r}
library(excelgesis)
xg_example()
```

Browse around the underlying XML inside those xlsx workbooks:

<https://jennybc.github.io/excelgesis/>

How the examples were prepared: Pick an example and store its path.

```{r}
(mg <- xg_example("mini-gap"))
```

```{r include = FALSE}
unlink("mini-gap", recursive = TRUE)
```

Unpack the xlsx, add some nice touches to make it more browser-friendly, and, if interactive, point a browser at the top-level directory.

```{r}
mg %>% 
  xg_unzip() %>% 
  xg_linkify() %>% 
  xg_browse()
```

```{r include = FALSE}
unlink("mini-gap", recursive = TRUE)
```
